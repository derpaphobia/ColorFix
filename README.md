# ColorFix
So I fell in love with some of "https://github.com/elenapan" colorthemes for terminals, and this scripts convert them to work with termux on an android phone

Dependencies:
pip3 install PyGithub requests

This is made for Python3 and you will need to create a github acces token and put that in the script for this to work.

I do not know if this will work on all android phones, I coded it specifically to download, convert and move them into place on my own phone, it does however download the theme/themes and converts them on any device, it will just error out on moving the files.

The script requires an argument.. either "-a" or "--all" to download all the colorthemes or just the name of the theme you want to download.

# This script was made for a VERY specific purpose at a very specific time and is only uploaded for demo purposes and will not necessarily be maintained in the future.
